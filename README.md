### Content of the repository:

#### 1) Homework1.py
It's a .py file that cointains the scripts for the solutions of the challenges

The only exercises that are missing are:

* 1 / 17 ---> Strings ---> Minion Game (it works for the test case 0, but gives Timerun Error for the rest of them)

* 15 / 17 ---> Regex ---> to finish these challenges I would like to read some more on Regex and Parsing, without copying the solutions 

* 1 / 2 ---> XML ---> XML2 - Find the Maximum Depth
